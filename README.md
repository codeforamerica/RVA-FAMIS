# RVA-FAMIS

The RVA team is planning on building a search tool for parents to quickly check which services are covered for their children under FAMIS. Along with services covered we plan to show copay amounts and human-readable descriptions of the services.

Potential phase 2 ideas include adding a click-based analytics platform to track the most frequent queries. We also plan to incorporate a "was this useful?" question for each service to ensure information is shared effectively.

One potential initial technology is TableTopJS, which will allow us to pull data from a Google spreadsheet (we recognize that this wouldn't be ideal for phase 2).
